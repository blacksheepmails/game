Notes about silly things you may not otherwise notice:


- x and y are used for coordinates and are floaty. These are pretty much just used for mousey stuff
- i and j are indices and are inty.
- right now functions are used as namespaces and executed every time which is really terrible and inefficient, but its fast enough for testing stuff out.. but still should change this later
